# JSON DB Structure for Analysis Results

The `tgentools` python toolkit can be run in `parse` mode to parse a set of
tgen log files. It writes useful statistics to a json file.

This document describes the structure of the json database file that gets exported
when running the `tgentools` python toolkit in `parse` mode.

The structure is given here with variable keys marked as such.
